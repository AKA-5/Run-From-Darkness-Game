# Run-From-Darkness-Game
The game is a simple yet engaging experience where the player must reach the end of a track consisting of simple game controls (WASD for player movement and SPACE for Jump). Currently, it features only one level, but I plan to add more levels with increasingly complex tracks in the future.

# How I Built
I developed the game using Unity and C#. I also utilized Amazon Q Developer, which significantly helped me write efficient code snippets and provided suggestions for improving my code. This tool was invaluable in enhancing my coding process.
